# social-share-grid
Social share online is fairly standard. A majority of websites have the ability to share content to your respective social network. This functionality usually comes in the form of a few small buttons in the website's navigation or a few icons under a breadcrumb. And while that approach has already proven to be successful we've decided to take it a step further. If your business is trying to gain a traction on social media, perhaps you want to add a social share grid to your homepage. Doing so gives social share more prominence, explains what content site visitors can expect from each respective channel, and also provides your standard social share functionaltity.
